# Changelog

All notable changes, newest first. Each entry records **what** changed and **why**. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions are project stages until the first release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`docs/` folder: changelog, architecture overview, build-stage status, ADRs** — the user asked for the project
  to be documented continuously with reasons, not just code. A CI job (`docs`) fails a PR that changes code without
  touching this changelog so the habit cannot lapse.
- **Merged `main` into the branch** — brings in the teammate's `CLAUDE.md` code-style rules and the
  `addyosmani/agent-skills` collection so the branch and main share one set of working rules.

## [Stage 0–1] — Foundation — 2026-09-27

Pull request: https://github.com/thesparselabs/muneem/pull/1

### Changed — design
- **Cloud backend switched from NestJS to Go (Echo)** in PRD, HLD and LLD — team decision. The HLD had chosen NestJS so
  the GST/costing/accounting engines could be literally shared between device and server. With Go they exist twice,
  so the docs now say how equality is *enforced* instead: one golden-vector fixture suite run by both languages, a
  nightly differential fuzz, and one OpenAPI document generating both sides' HTTP types. See [ADR-0001](decisions/0001-go-echo-cloud-with-fixture-contract.md).

### Added — shared foundation (`packages/`)
- **`@muneem/domain` money kernel** (`divRound`, `pctOf`, `apportion`) — money is integer paise and rounding is
  HALF_UP in exactly one place, because NFR-004 forbids float money and two devices must compute the same total.
  `apportion` uses BigInt because a 500-line wholesale invoice overflows 2^53 in `total × weight`. See [ADR-0002](decisions/0002-integer-money-and-shared-numeric-bounds.md).
- **GST engine `computeInvoice`** — LLD §3.1 step order verbatim (inclusive back-calc divides by `10000+gst+cess`;
  `sgst = total − cgst` so halves re-sum; bill discount apportioned before tax; optional rupee round-off to its own
  field; GSTR-1 bucket). Percent discounts are taken in basis points so no float ever enters.
- **89 golden invoices** (19 hand-verified, rest engine-generated then frozen) — the cross-language contract; a diff
  in the fixture file is a behaviour change to review, never something to regenerate to get green.
- **ESLint rule banning `Math.round`, `toFixed` and float division on financial identifiers** in domain code —
  turns a design rule into a build error.
- **`@muneem/contracts`**: zod IPC registry (the preload is generated from it), LLD §17 error taxonomy, resource×action
  permissions with grant limits, concrete role presets (no "optional" grants), OpenAPI 3.0 HTTP contract — one source
  of truth for method shape, permission and rate limit.
- **`@muneem/db-sqlite`**: LLD §2 pragmas on every open, migrator with pre-migration verified backup and rollback,
  Stage 1 schema, append-only triggers on `audit_log`, sha256 hash-chained audit writer, transactional outbox writer,
  repositories where every write is one transaction (row + local sequence + audit + outbox). Outbox rows are written
  from day one because retrofitting them means rewriting the transaction everything depends on (Constraint 8).
  See [ADR-0006](decisions/0006-outbox-from-day-one-sync-worker-in-stage-7.md).
- **`scripts/schema-lint.ts`** fails CI on any REAL/FLOAT/NUMERIC financial column in SQLite or Postgres migrations.
- **`scripts/diff-fuzz.ts`** runs random invoices through the TypeScript and Go engines and fails on a single paise
  of difference; 11,000 cases across three seeds were identical.

### Added — cloud (`cloud/`, Go + Echo)
- Go port of money and GST engines, tested against the *same* fixture files; `cmd/verify-fixture` for the fuzz.
- Postgres migrations (golang-migrate, embedded) with row-level security on every tenant table and least-privilege
  roles (`muneem_api` cannot delete or update audit rows) — NFR-008 multi-tenant isolation as a database guarantee.
- Identity: Argon2id passwords in PHC format (so the desktop can verify the same string offline), HS256 access tokens
  (15 min), rotating refresh tokens with family reuse detection.
- Devices: Ed25519 request signatures, registration idempotent on `installation_id`, revocation.
- Business/branch/terminal endpoints idempotent on the client-minted ULID, so an offline device can create them and
  sync later without duplicates.

### Added — desktop (`apps/desktop`, Electron + React)
- Secure renderer (contextIsolation, sandbox, CSP, navigation denied); preload **generated** from the contract
  registry with a test asserting the exposed surface equals the registry.
- IPC gateway per LLD §10.3: validate → session → RBAC → rate limit → dispatch → audit → envelope; errors carry a
  code and never a stack or SQL text.
- Online login registers the device and caches an Argon2id hash of the entered password; offline login verifies it
  and enforces `max_offline_days`; PIN switch with 5-attempt lockout; `auth.login` falls back to offline when the
  server is unreachable (FR-004).
- Business setup wizard, settings, diagnostics (health, integrity check incl. audit-chain verify, backup, support
  bundle handle, log tail).
- `scripts/crash-loop.ts` — 50 SIGKILLs mid-write left no partial rows; `test/e2e-live.test.ts` — spawns the real Go
  API and proves the Stage 1 exit criterion end to end.

### Fixed — during integration
- Desktop signed requests with an RFC 3339 timestamp while the Go verifier expected unix seconds; would have rejected
  every signed request. Convention now written into the OpenAPI doc and `SYNC_HEADERS`. See [ADR-0003](decisions/0003-device-signature-convention.md).
- Dev Postgres moved from host port 5432 to 5433 — clashed with a locally installed Postgres.
- OpenAPI downgraded 3.1 → 3.0.3 — `oapi-codegen` does not fully support 3.1 and no 3.1 feature was used.
- CI: pnpm version now comes from `package.json` `packageManager` (the action refuses two sources); Go API types are
  generated before `go build` (they are gitignored); Go version is read from `cloud/go.mod` because the module ended
  up on Go 1.26 and setup-go v7 no longer auto-upgrades. See [ADR-0004](decisions/0004-ci-reads-go-version-from-go-mod.md).
- GitHub Actions bumped to Node 24 majors to clear runner deprecation warnings.

### Deferred (deliberately)
- Sync worker (Stage 7): local businesses sit in `sync_outbox`; device registration and login do hit the server.
- Token auto-refresh on 401, Playwright UI test, NSIS installer build, Windows-host validation.
